# CQG-MBQA Medical Domain Adaptation - Project Kickoff

## Project Setup Complete âœ…

### Environment Verification
- **Conda Environment**: `cqgmbqa` activated and tested
- **Dependencies**: PyTorch, sentence-transformers, OpenAI API installed
- **GPU Access**: H100 GPUs available with memory management protocol
- **Framework**: CQG-MBQA baseline established and validated

### Initial Analysis Results
- **Pretrained Model**: 9,614 general domain questions loaded successfully
- **Embedding Quality**: Theme-specific discriminative patterns confirmed
- **API Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o batch processing validated
- **Analysis Tools**: Comprehensive embedding analysis implemented

### Research Objectives Defined
1. Adapt CQG framework for medical domain question generation
2. Train MBQA on medical-specific question-answer pairs  
3. Produce interpretable medical text embeddings
4. Validate clinical relevance and performance

### Framework Understanding
- **CQG Pipeline**: Contrastive question generation with clustering
- **MBQA Training**: Multi-task binary classification on generated questions
- **Interpretability**: Each embedding dimension = confidence in specific medical question
- **Evaluation**: MTEB benchmark adaptation for medical domain

### Ready for Medical Domain Development
All baseline components validated and ready for medical domain adaptation. Framework modifications will follow incremental testing approach to preserve core functionality while adding medical-specific capabilities.

### Next Immediate Steps
1. Medical corpus collection and preprocessing
2. Medical question generation parameter tuning
3. Domain-specific evaluation metric development
4. Clinical validation framework setup
